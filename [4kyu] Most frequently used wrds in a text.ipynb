    "Apostrophes can appear at the start, middle or end of a word ('abc, abc', 'abc', ab'c are all valid)\n",
    "Any other characters (e.g. #, \\, / , . ...) are not part of a word and should be treated as whitespace.\n",
    "Matches should be case-insensitive, and the words in the result should be lowercased.\n",
    "Ties may be broken arbitrarily.\n",
    "If a text contains fewer than three unique words, then either the top-2 or top-1 words should be returned, or an empty array if a text contains no words."
